Weather/Address API

This program adds two API calls to the web API server - one to check the address of a given host and one to check the weather of a given host - both using code from lab 2. 

The first api call is http://-server-/address/-your host name|ip-

The second api call is http://-server-/weather/-your host name|ip-

e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather/amazon.com  or http://127.0.0.1:5000/address/8.8.8.8

Each new call will be cached for a faster return on repeated calls
