ok heres the rub:
we will build an image named "flasky" that copies front end files, exposes port 9001, and builds a flask server hosting our services.

in /CYBR410_GroupProject/Frontend/Flask/ run the command
docker build -t flasky .

we will build a second image named "fningx" that deploys an nginx webserver on 8080, as well as configures the server to redirect to our flask deployment. 

in /CYBR410_GroupProject/Frontend/nginx/ run the command  
docker build -t fnginx .

we then run our docker compose file to put the two together.

in /CYBR410_GroupProject/Frontend/ run the command
sudo docker compose up

navigate to "localhost:8080". Viola, magnefique, chefs kiss... we did it.
