The threat model for this group project involves simulating a real-world attack which will be conducted by students from the cyber operations class. These students will attempt to breach the security of the deployed systems. The primary aim is to generate network traffic that the defense class can log and analyze allowing for demonstration of understanding attack patterns and defensive measures. The assets at risk include the web server, which hosts the user interface and services, the Flask server, managing API requests, the logging system, capturing all network traffic, and the defense mechanisms, including honeypots and iptables rules. The primary attack surfaces are network ports, the web application, honeypots, and user authentication. Potential threats include port scanning using tools like Nmap to discover open ports and services, service enumeration to identify running services and their versions, and brute force or credential stuffing attacks against the SSH access. Each piece of the system will be explained in further sections in the paper below.

Some of the attacks that are expected are basic nmap scanning to find the open ports and find service information. It is also expected that attackers will search for weak passwords for ssh and possibly attempt password bruteforcing such as through a tool like hydra. (I'm gonna tag the testing and results page somewhere here to show what we expect)
