The threat model for this group project involves simulating a real-world attack which will be conducted by students from the cyber operations class. These students will attempt to breach the security of the deployed systems. The primary aim is to generate network traffic that the defense class can log and analyze allowing for demonstration of understanding attack patterns and defensive measures. Currently at risk assets include the web server, which hosts the user interface and services and the Flask server, which manages API requests. The primary attack surfaces are network ports, the web application, honeypots, and user authentication. Anticipated threats include the use of Nmap to initially enumerate the server. Information gained will likely include open ports and services, as well as running services and their versions. Itâ€™s also very likely that we will see brute force or credential stuffing attacks. Each piece of the system that pertains to defense and infrastructure will be explained further below.

As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, anticipated attacks are basic nmap scans that will discover ports and service information. It is also expected that attackers will search for weak passwords for ssh and possibly attempt password brute forcing through a tool like hydra. (I'm gonna tag the testing and results page somewhere here to show what we expect)
