Honeypots are widely used tools that can provide invaluable data when in a defensive position. In general, theyâ€™re decoys that lure attackers in to allow a defensive team to study the incoming attacks. In this project specifically, \hyperref{https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{opencanary} has been implemented. Major benefits of this implementation are its extremely low resource requirements and the easy extensibility. It can be a good way to get IPs scanning networks, as the only case it should be discovered is if someone is scanning the entire network searching for vulnerabilities. Use of this stemmed from a want to diversify the implemented defensive techniques. By incorporating opencanary it has allowed greater surface from which logs can be collected which is extremely valuable for an evolving defense. Additionally, malicious IPs can be identified more regularly, presenting the opportunity to create IP blocking rules in the future.
