The bash script I've made automates the monitoring of a system by capturing system activity using the sysdig tool every 30 minutes. Each session stops when the data file reaches about 20 MB or after 4 hours of total runtime. The script checks if each generated file exceeds a size limit of 20MB and, if so, runs a specific program. This can be useful for system monitoring, security analysis, and troubleshooting. The script helps manage data capture efficiently but requires careful consideration regarding storage, privacy, and the potential impact on system performance.
