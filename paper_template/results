After combining all components into a final working network with a web app with multiple services the next stage was to analyze each of the services. 
Analyzing the services is what the first step that a malicious actor might take which would also be called surveillance. Using surveillance tools 
such as nmap, gobuster, or a ping sweep to map the hops of the system to checking what ports are available. One thing to note is that the tools listed 
are not exclusively used by malicious actors but are used by admins to provide better Cybersecurity solutions which is what the researchers of this 
study are applying.

To reveal some detailed information about the network and that the web app is running on the first  tool used is an nmap command on the Linux terminal 
with the -sC and -sV flags which respectively will gather very detailed information and the version that a service is operating on the network. In the 
study the services are revealed as well as what ports those services operate on for example it can be observed that there is an OpenSSH service 
operating on port 22 which is tcp. A Defensive measure to protect this service would be to look at the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) for 
OpenSSH. Looking at the CVE for OpenSSH if the service is the most updated version then admins might try to defend the encrypted key protocol to keep 
it messages from being deleting.

The ports that were revealed through an nmap scan also show that there is little security in protecting routing. This was observed as typing the port 
number at the end of the url such as “/9000” would reveal a webpage that had a scramble of letters and characters. This vulnerability could be remedy 
through proper routing controls so that url redirection attacks are minimized. In addition to eliminating security threats, testing was implemented on 
SSH for weak passwords. Passwords that were identified as weak were changed.
