In today's digital landscape, deploying web services with security and efficiency is paramount. This project focuses on harnessing the power of Kubernetes (K8s) orchestration to achieve these goals. Kubernetes provides an ideal platform for hosting critical web services. In this endeavor, we will deploy an Nginx server to deliver an IP-to-Physical Address service and a weather service, ensuring these services are highly available and performant.

Security is a cornerstone of our approach. We will implement a multi-layered defense strategy, incorporating honeypot mechanisms to detect and deflect potential threats. For real-time monitoring and comprehensive logging, we will leverage Sysdig, a powerful tool that offers deep visibility into the system's behavior. This combination of advanced security measures and monitoring tools will safeguard our services against a wide range of cyber threats.

Furthermore, by utilizing Kubernetes, we aim to optimize resource utilization and enhance fault tolerance. Kubernetesâ€™ inherent capabilities in managing containerized applications will allow us to seamlessly scale our services according to demand, ensuring continuous availability and reliability. This project underscores the critical importance of efficient and secure web service deployment in meeting the growing demands of modern users and enterprises.
