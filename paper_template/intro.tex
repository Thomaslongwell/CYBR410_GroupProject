This project is designed to have groupmates work together to design and implement a full deployment. Each team mate was assigned a specific piece of the deployment as their responsibility and each section of this paper relates to a section of the deployment. Front-End is in charge of creating the user interface of the deployment as well as the web server that will host the services. The Services team then implemented an URL to physical location feature as well as a URL to current weather forecast converter. Behind the scenes the Defense team integrated an IP blocking honeypot to deter attacks, while Logging used a Sysdig script to keep a record of all traffic. This was handed to Orchestration, who spun up the servers on the designated IP assigned by the professor.
