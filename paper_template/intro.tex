This project was made to show our understanding of various cybersecurity related concepts. By deploying a complex web server, we were given an opportunity to display the knowledge we gleaned from the course, and to give Stu's class a chance to demonstrate their own skills by attempting to break it. This project was designed to have groupmates work together to design and implement a full deployment. Each teammate was assigned a specific piece of the deployment as their responsibility and each section of this paper relates to a section of the deployment. Front-End is in charge of creating the user interface of the deployment as well as the web server that will host the services. The Services team then implemented a URL to physical location feature as well as a URL to the current weather forecast converter. Behind the scenes the Defense team integrated an IP blocking honeypot, an easy to access fake deployment with false services \cite{nawrocki2016survey} to deter attacks, while Logging used a Sysdig script to keep a record of all traffic. This was handed to Orchestration, who spun up the servers on the designated IP assigned by the professor.
